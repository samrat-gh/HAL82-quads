We are developing this product as a part of Hackathon under Theme "Tech Entrepreneurship & Startup Innovation". This project is a platform to connect founders, cofounders and investors. 
We have already build this product to some extent (Basic UI & Auth Done), and now we are making it full fledge.

Requirements:
The User as Founder should be able to establish his/her profile in an extent. The Founder should be able to keep assosiate itself to its product with Product Name, Product Description, Logo, Founded at (Time), No of active users (currently), No of monthly Traffic (currently), Monthly Revenue through Product (currently). While we say this, it is optional for the founder to add its product stat so it should be designed that way. The founder should be able to keep his current product status as (Idea Stage, Building Stage, Launched / Traction Stage, etc. ) and also status like looking for a co-founder or Founding Engineer.

The user as CoFounder should be able to add his/her skills, experience, current status ( Active looking to work, or looking to be part of fouding engineer). The CoFounder should be able to add his or her achievements in the form of his/her career logs. 
 
The user as Investor should be able to add his/her association with organization, his type (Angel Investor, Venture Capital VC or Institutional & Strategic Investors). The investor should be able to maintain his/her investment logs like invested in X Startup, Exited from Y startup, Invested in B Startup which grew by 300% and so on.  

every user should be able to link their portfolio website, linkedin on the platform for better trustablility.  

This platform is also a listing platform, that helps founders find co-founders, and co-founders find founders and investor to find founders to investor and founders find investors to pitch their startup online. For that we will again need to customize feed of founders, co founders and investors.

For that, we need to have to collect onboarding criteria through which we can recommend or match the different users based on their preference. (Help me gain more clarity on this part)
Now Also let me know what else can we have
